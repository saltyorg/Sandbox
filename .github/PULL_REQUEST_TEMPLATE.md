# Description

For new roles please include a brief description of what this app does, or what the purpose of this role is. Include a link to the docker container used, the projects home page and a link to the documentation if it exists.

It would be greatly appreciated if you create a sandbox documentation page yourself and do a PR into the [docs repo](https://github.com/saltyorg/docs).  You, as the person creating the role, have presumably used the thing and are presumably familiar with any setup steps required.  Anyone else here would need to research that.
